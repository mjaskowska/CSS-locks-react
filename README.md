## CSS Locks generator

[Check it out](https://mjaskowska.github.io/CSS-locks-react)

When a value (like font-size) is flexible with viewport units, it might result in a value that is too big or too small. Solution to this problem may be locking it in media queries using calc function. Letâ€™s be honest, no one wants to bother with so much 'complicated' math! This app automatically generates functions that are ready to copy straight into CSS code.
React app built with functional components using Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS/SCSS
