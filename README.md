Have you always wanted to implement responsive font sizes in your projects but never knew how to calculate CSS locks?
            
Fear no more! This app will handle all that complicated math for you! :)
            
Simply specify values of minimum and maximum font-size property that you want on your two breakpoints (media queries) and paste the code below straight into your SASS/CSS file.

#### Easy!



_This is a React version, you can also see my repo of JavaScript version [here](https://github.com/mjaskowska/CSS-locks-javascript.git)._
